Para um topo de bolo de aniversário de uma menina chamada Anna Luiza do Lilo & Stitch, o prompt deve ser o seguinte:

“A birthday cake topper design featuring the Portuguese name ‘Anna Luiza’ in elegant cursive script, dark blue color, glossy and friendly style. Below the name, four cute cartoon illustrations of Stitch (from Lilo & Stitch) in different poses: sitting with a small red heart, lying down with paws stretched forward, standing playfully with hands on ears, and smiling shyly with pink hearts floating around. Use vibrant shades of blue, purple, and light pink for ears and hearts. Each element should have a white outline sticker effect, giving a clean cut-out look. Focus only on the characters and text, no background — ideal for a cake topper or printable decoration.”

Topo simples escrito "Parabéns" em letras cursivas e duas cores.

A flat sticker-style wordmark of the Portuguese word ‘Parabéns’, written in smooth cursive rounded letters. The fill color should be a matte purple with soft lilac tones, no shine or reflections, creating a calm and modern aesthetic. The outline should be a slightly darker purple, and the outer border pure white, maintaining contrast and clarity. The overall style must look clean, elegant, and minimalistic — ideal for printed or cut vinyl lettering. Focus only on the text, no background.”
